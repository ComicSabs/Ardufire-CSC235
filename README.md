# Ardufire-CSC235
Code for an interactive model airplane using Arduino. Created for CSC 235 at Berry College as a final project.
This is a simple bit of code that I used to control 3 servo motors and 1 DC motor; the servos were controlled using a push button,
and the DC motor was controlled using a potentiometer.
